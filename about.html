        <p>Hiya, I’m Will.</p>
        <p>GitHub is the current home of software I’ve developed to help
        me do my job as a scientist.</p>
        <p>From a scientific perspective, I’m interested in how software
        can be used to encode chemical knowledge and process chemical
        data in a clear, reproducible and open manner.</p>
        <p>From a practical point of view, I like how programming allows
        for the creation of just about any analysis method or research
        tool you can imagine.</p>
        <p>I use some of these tools for rapidly creating scripts which
        organise various kinds of data in a chemically meaningful way.
        Some of them help with preparing documents.</p>
        <p>In sharing this software, I hope it will be useful for other
        chemists and scientists in getting their work done and
        developing new ideas, even if it just serves as an example.</p>
        <p>As always, there is more than one way to clean an NMR
        tube.</p>
        <p>Oh, and if you’re just getting started- <a

        git</a>! (other version control software is available).</p>
        <p>These pages were generated from markdown, css and svg <a

        files</a>.</p>
