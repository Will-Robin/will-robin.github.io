<p>GitHub is the current home of software I’ve developed to help me do
my job as a systems chemist. I’m interested in how software can be used
to encode chemical knowledge and process chemical data in a clear,
reproducible and open manner. I also like how programming allows for the
creation of just about any analysis method or research tool you can
imagine.</p>
<p>I can only speak from my own experience using the software (hence
“I”). These tools are very powerful and convenient for doing the kind of
work I do day-to-day. I can use them for rapidly creating scripts which
organise various kinds of data in a chemically meaningful way, and
interface them with key Python libraries such as Numpy, SciPy and
Scikit-Learn. As a result, I can get to and navigate the hard parts of
data analysis (i.e. the scientific part) in a much more efficient way
than I could with spreadsheets, for example. By sharing this software, I
hope it will be useful for other chemists and scientists in getting
their work done and developing new ideas, even if it just serves as an
example. As always, there is more than one way to clean an NMR tube.</p>
