[ChromProcess](https://github.com/Will-Robin/ChromProcess) is  Python package for handling chromatography data. It is designed to aid in automation for processing of sets of chromatograms, containing basic functionality for peak picking and integration. Some text-based file types and `.cdf` files can be read by ChromProcess. Given data and some analysis details, ChromProcess can create peak tables and data reports reporting on how chromatographic peaks change across a series of chromatograms. The API documentation for ChromProcess is found [here](https://will-robin.github.io/ChromProcess/index.html).
