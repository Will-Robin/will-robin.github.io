GitHub is the current home of software I've developed to help me do my job as a scientist.

From a scientific perspective, I'm interested in how software can be used to encode chemical knowledge and process chemical data in a clear, reproducible and open manner.

From a practical point of view, I like how programming allows for the creation of just about any analysis method or research tool you can imagine.

I've found these tools quite enabling for the kind of work I do day-to-day.

On one hand, I use them for rapidly creating scripts which organise various kinds of data in a chemically meaningful way. The code can then be easily interfaced with key Python libraries such as Numpy, SciPy and Scikit-Learn. As a result, navigating the hard parts of data analysis (i.e. the scientific part) can be done in a much more efficient way than using spreadsheets, for example.

On the other, in some cases it takes me as less time to write a program to solve a simple problem than to find, install and learn how to use software which may already solve that problem.

By sharing this software, I hope it will be useful for other chemists and scientists in getting their work done and developing new ideas, even if it just serves as an example. As always, there is more than one way to clean an NMR tube.
