Hiya, I'm Will.

GitHub is the current home of software I've developed to help me do my job as a scientist.

From a scientific perspective, I'm interested in how software can be used to encode chemical knowledge and process chemical data in a clear, reproducible and open manner.

From a practical point of view, I like how programming allows for the creation of just about any analysis method or research tool you can imagine.

I use some of these tools for rapidly creating scripts which organise various kinds of data in a chemically meaningful way. Some of them help with preparing documents.

In sharing this software, I hope it will be useful for other chemists and scientists in getting their work done and developing new ideas, even if it just serves as an example.

As always, there is more than one way to clean an NMR tube.

Oh, and if you're just getting started- [learn git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)! (other version control software is available).

These pages were generated from markdown, css and svg [source files](https://github.com/Will-Robin/will-robin.github.io).
