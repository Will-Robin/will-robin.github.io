GitHub is the current home of software I've developed to help me do my job as a systems chemist. I'm interested in how software can be used to encode chemical knowledge and process chemical data in a clear, reproducible and open manner. I also like how programming allows for the creation of just about any analysis method or research tool you can imagine.

I can only speak from my own experience using the software (hence "I"). These tools are very powerful and convenient for doing the kind of work I do day-to-day. I can use them for rapidly creating scripts which organise various kinds of data in a chemically meaningful way, and interface them with key Python libraries such as Numpy, SciPy and Scikit-Learn. As a result, I can get to and navigate the hard parts of data analysis (i.e. the scientific part) in a much more efficient way than I could with spreadsheets, for example. By sharing this software, I hope it will be useful for other chemists and scientists in getting their work done and developing new ideas, even if it just serves as an example. As always, there is more than one way to clean an NMR tube.
