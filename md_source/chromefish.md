[Chromefish](https://github.com/Will-Robin/Chromefish) is a proof-of-principle browser-based application for chromatography processing. It uses a Flask server to interface ChromProcess to a visual interface, which allows the user to view a chromatogram and pick peaks. Developed in an afternoon, it is by no means fit for purpose, but hopefully the general idea shows how scientists requiring simple chromatography processing tasks do not necessarily have to shell out large sums of money for commercial software.
