[Taggregate](https://github.com/Will-Robin/Taggregate) is a set of Python scripts for managing figure labelling across multiple documents for integration with Pandoc and some of the filters from Moonuscript. Mainly, it uses regexes to find instances of 'tags' for figures in text, and organises them for numbering. I constantly have issues in cross-referencing supplementary figure numbers with the main text and in the SI document itself. No matter how carefully I and my colleagues check, there is always a finite chance that an incorrect SI figure number slips through the cracks, especially when drafting and re-drafting. This software has helped in this respect. Still, it's no substitute for careful inspection!
