[Taggregate](https://github.com/Will-Robin/Taggregate) is a set of Python scripts for managing figure labelling across multiple documents for integration with Pandoc and some of the filters from [Moonuscript](https://github.com/Will-Robin/moonuscript). Mainly, it uses regexes to find instances of 'tags' for figures in text, and organises them for numbering. I constantly have issues in cross-referencing supplementary figure numbers with the main text and in the SI document itself. No matter how carefully I and my colleagues check, there is always a finite chance that an incorrect SI figure number slips through the cracks, especially when drafting and re-drafting. This software has helped in this respect. Still, it's no substitute for careful inspection!
