[FlowCalc](https://github.com/Will-Robin/FlowCalc) is a Python package for planning flow experiments, in particular it helps in generating flow profiles for syringe pumps. The software only supports one kind of flow profile output suitable for a certain brand of syringe pumps, but can be modified for others. The interface for the code attempts to aid the user in creating complex experimental designs whilst keeping track of units, etc.
