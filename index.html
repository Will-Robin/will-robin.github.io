<section id="northnet" class="level2">
<h2>NorthNet</h2>
<p>A package for working with chemical reaction networks. You can find a
discussion of NorthNet <a href="northnet.html">here</a>.</p>

<section id="chromprocess" class="level2">
<h2>ChromProcess</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Will-Robin/ChromProcess">ChromProcess</a>
is Python package for handling chromatography data. It is designed to
aid in automation for processing of sets of chromatograms, containing
basic functionality for peak picking and integration. Some text-based
file types and <code>.cdf</code> files can be read by ChromProcess.
Given data and some analysis details, ChromProcess can create peak
tables and data reports reporting on how chromatographic peaks change
across a series of chromatograms. <a

documentation for ChromProcess is found here.</a></p>
</section>
<section id="chromefish" class="level2">
<h2>Chromefish</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Will-Robin/Chromefish">Chromefish</a> is
a proof-of-principle browser-based application for chromatography
processing. It uses a Flask server to interface ChromProcess to a visual
interface, which allows the user to view a chromatogram and pick peaks.
Developed in an afternoon, it is by no means fit for purpose, but
hopefully the general idea shows how scientists requiring simple
chromatography processing tasks do not necessarily have to shell out
large sums of money for commercial software.</p>

<section id="flowcalc" class="level2">
<h2>FlowCalc</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Will-Robin/FlowCalc">FlowCalc</a> is a
Python package for planning flow experiments, in particular it helps in
generating flow profiles for syringe pumps. The software only supports
one kind of flow profile output suitable for a certain brand of syringe
pumps, but can be modified for others. The interface for the code
attempts to aid the user in creating complex experimental designs whilst
keeping track of units, etc.</p>

<section id="moonuscript" class="level2">
<h2>Moonuscript</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Will-Robin/moonuscript">Moonuscript</a>
is a set of Lua filters for <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>
which I’ve used in some projects. They are designed to help with
connecting data to documents, the automation of repetitive, potentially
error-prone tasks, and some convenience things.</p>
</section>
<section id="taggregate" class="level2">
<h2>Taggregate</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Will-Robin/Taggregate">Taggregate</a> is
a set of Python scripts for managing figure labelling across multiple
documents for integration with Pandoc and some of the filters from
Moonuscript. Mainly, it uses regexes to find instances of ‘tags’ for
figures in text, and organises them for numbering. I constantly have
issues in cross-referencing supplementary figure numbers with the main
text and in the SI document itself. No matter how carefully I and my
colleagues check, there is always a finite chance that an incorrect SI
figure number slips through the cracks, especially when drafting and
re-drafting. This software has helped in this respect. Still, it’s no
substitute for careful inspection!</p>
