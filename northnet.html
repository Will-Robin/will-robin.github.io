<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Will-Robin/NorthNet">NorthNet</a> is a
Python package for handling information on chemical reaction networks
(CRNs). It is designed to solve the problem of interacting with the
architecture of CRNs, which can be as simple as building and editing
CRNs at the level of reactions and compounds represented in a computer
model. At its core is the <code>Network</code> CRN model structure which
can be interacted with using code which is chemically meaningful.</p>
<p>If you have ever written down a large number of chemical reactions by
hand, you may appreciate what a mechanical process the task is. Organic
chemistry can be quite repetitive, in particular. A good example of such
mechanical repetitiveness is the formose reaction. Start with a sugar,
form its enol, aldol addition/protonate, repeat. You can build quite a
large network of chemical reactions following these steps. However, you
may realise at a later point that you’d like to introduce a new type of
reaction. If you’re modifying a scheme on paper, or even in a graphical
user interface on a computer, adding in the new reactions can be ever
harder that starting from scratch. It is necessary to find the right
compounds for the reactions, find space on the page in which to add the
new reactions, and what if two compounds for either side of the scheme
have to react together? It is certainly possible to write a complex
reaction network on paper, but at the costs of time and legibility.
That’s ignoring the possibility of errors.</p>
<p>The above situation is what we faced in work <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-022-00956-7">combining
high-throughput reaction data, chemical reaction networks and prebiotic
chemistry</a> (<a href="https://rdcu.be/cO4qW">public read access
here</a>). There was a lot to keep track of for this paper, including a
potentially large number of reaction pathways available within the
formose reaction space. The code which became NorthNet allowed us to
manage this complex part of the project, as well as giving us an ‘in
silico’ model of the formose reaction.</p>
<p>I’m intending to use NorthNet (or similar software) in future work.
It is open source since I believe that’s the right thing to do (without
going into details). It is a good thing to make code available, but
that’s not enough. For others to benefit, code also needs to be
documented, explained and demonstrated. Not to mention tested,
maintained and distributed. A lot of work.</p>
<p>The API documentation for NorthNet is available <a
href="https://will-robin.github.io/NorthNet/NorthNet.html">here</a>.
This is where you can go to get an outline of the NorthNet code. The
code itself ideally should show the reader how it works. The <a
href="https://github.com/Will-Robin/NorthNet/tree/main/scripts">scripts</a>
folder in the repository gives some examples of how to use the code.</p>
<p>Here, some general informal explanation is provided.</p>
<h1 id="managing-interconnected-chemical-reaction-information">Managing
Interconnected Chemical Reaction Information</h1>
<p>If you take a look in <code>NorthNet.Classes</code>, you’ll see
several files containing code referring to chemical concepts. For
example, there is the <code>Reaction</code> class which represents
reactions and the <code>Compound</code> class, which represents
compounds (reactants and products). This code uses the excellent package
<a href="https://www.rdkit.org">The RDKit</a> for the chemoinformatics
heavy lifting behind the scenes. We’ll get to the others later, but the
third relevant class here is <code>Network</code>. This class links
together compounds and reactions into a chemical reaction network data
structure.</p>
<p>The mental model behind the <code>Network</code> class is that
compounds are connected to each other by reactions. For example, a
reaction connects <code>A</code> to <code>B</code> in the reaction
<code>A → B</code>, which as a result can be stated as
<code>A → reaction → B</code>. Note the arrows which show how
<code>A</code> is a reactant and <code>B</code> is a product. Apply this
logic to lots of other reactions which connect to this one via
reactants/products, and you have a model for the structure of a reaction
network structure and its components.</p>
<p>The connections between compounds and reactions are realised using
Python’s dictionary (<code>dict()</code>) data structure. If you’re not
sure what a dictionary is, the basic idea is that one uses a key to
access values stored in the dictionary. In the <code>Network</code>
class, unique <code>Reaction</code> objects are stored in a dictionary
and are accessible using a key corresponding to the reaction SMILES
derived from the reaction. <code>Compound</code> objects are stored in a
similar way. Connections between reactions and compounds are made by
sharing keys between them. Each <code>Reaction</code> object has
<code>Reactants</code> and <code>Products</code> attributes, which are
lists of SMILES keys to compounds. Each compound has <code>In</code> and
<code>Out</code> attributes, which store reaction SMILES keys, keying to
reactions. Therefore, given any compound, one can immediately find all
the reactions in which it is a reactant (by examining the
<code>Out</code> attribute) or product (<code>In</code>), and the other
way around for a reaction (given in <code>Reactants</code> and
<code>Products</code> attributes). For this to work, it is important
that each reaction and compound has a unique identifier. NorthNet uses
canonicalised SMILES strings to achieve this standardisation.</p>
<p>This ‘bipartite’ network structure has two kinds of nodes:
<code>NetworkReactions</code> and <code>NetworkCompounds</code>.
Compounds can only connect to reactions, and reactions can only connect
to compounds.</p>
<h1 id="manipulating-network-structure">Manipulating Network
Structure</h1>
<p>The <code>Network</code> class has methods for adding and removing
reactions (<code>network.add_reactions([Reaction, ...])</code>/
<code>network.remove_reactions([Reaction, ...])</code>) and compounds
(<code>network.add_compounds([Compound, ...])</code>/
<code>network.remove_compounds([Compound, ...])</code>). These methods
make it easy to add or remove network components without having to
manually clean up the underlying dictionaries to remove any ‘loose end’
reactions without reactants or products, for example. Methods for
removing single compounds or reactions are also available
(e.g. <code>network.remove_compound(Compound)</code>).</p>
<h1 id="network-generation">Network Generation</h1>
<p>NorthNet contains a network generation module, which allows for
rule-based chemical reaction generation within the organisation of the
<code>Network</code> class. Again, the core of this operation is code
from The RDKit, but NorthNet marshals the reaction generation operations
to perform them and store their results in a well defined manner.</p>
<p>Network generation uses the <code>ReactionTemplate</code> and
<code>Substructure</code> classes (in addition to <code>Compound</code>,
<code>Reaction</code> and <code>Network</code>).
<code>ReactionTemplate</code> wraps up <a
href="https://www.rdkit.org/docs/RDKit_Book.html#chemical-reaction-handling">reaction
SMARTS</a>, whilst <code>Substructure</code> wraps up <a
href="https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html">SMARTS</a>.</p>
<p>Designing (reaction) SMARTS patterns is beyond the scope of this
document. Examples can be found in the <a
href="https://github.com/Will-Robin/NorthNet/tree/main/scripts">scripts</a>
directory of the repo.</p>
<p>A network generation operation consists of finding compounds in the
network which have substructure matches with the substructures defined
in the <code>ReactiveSubstructures</code> attribute of a
<code>ReactionTemplate</code> object. Reaction transformations are then
performed on the selected compounds, and new reactions and compounds are
added to the network. This process can be repeated with the same
reaction type or other reaction types to build large network
structures.</p>
<h1 id="pathway-searching">Pathway searching</h1>
<p>Originally, I intended on implementing pathway search algorithms with
use the <code>Network</code> data structure. I did some work to that
end, but realised that it would be more sensible to use <a
href="https://networkx.org">NetworkX</a> for pathway searching. This
interface is enabled using the <code>network.to_networkx()</code> method
to create a NetworkX DiGraph object with the same structure as the
NorthNet <code>Network</code>. Why not just start from NetworkX in the
first place? NorthNet provides a chemically meaningful interface to
network creation and manipulation. Similar operations could be performed
with a NetworkX DiGraph, but at the expense of clarity over the
insertion and removal of chemical information.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>That’s the end, for now. I use NorthNet as a tool for keeping track
of large sets of reactions, as a reference, and as a kind of ‘database’
as part of investigations.</p>
