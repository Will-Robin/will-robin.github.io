        is a set of Python scripts for managing figure labelling across
        multiple documents for integration with Pandoc and some of the
        filters from <a
        href="https://github.com/Will-Robin/moonuscript">Moonuscript</a>.
        Mainly, it uses regexes to find instances of ‘tags’ for figures
        in text, and organises them for numbering. I constantly have
        issues in cross-referencing supplementary figure numbers with
        the main text and in the SI document itself. No matter how
        carefully I and my colleagues check, there is always a finite
        chance that an incorrect SI figure number slips through the
        cracks, especially when drafting and re-drafting. This software
        has helped in this respect. Still, it’s no substitute for
        careful inspection!</p>
